# CommitLog
The Developer Diary(still working on it)<br>
Document your descent into code madness, one brain-commit at a time.<br>
This is GitHub commits but for your brain.<br>
You wake up. You code. You forget what you did.<br>
CommitLog is your daily mental changelog.<br>
Log it before you lose it.<br>
That’s it. That’s the app.<br>

## Features (if you can even call them that)<br>
-Brain commits — Write down what you did today before your neurons delete it.<br>
-Daily dev journaling — Because “what did you work on today?” shouldn’t cause an existential crisis.<br>
-Local storage — No cloud. No sync. Just raw, uncooked brain data.<br>
-Zero bloat — No AI. No Markdown. No distractions. Just vibes and words.<br>
-Mentally therapeutic — Surprisingly good for your sanity. Like yelling into a void, but productive.<br>

## Tech Stack (the overengineered kind)<br>
Layer Tech<br>
Frontend React.js (obviously)<br>
Styling CSS (minimal, emotionally unstable)<br>
Storage LocalStorage (your brain’s RAM)<br>
Backend Haha what backend?<br>

## How to Run (you poor soul)<br>
git clone https://github.com/nishasingh-49/commitlog.git<br>
cd commitlog<br>
npm install<br>
npm start<br>

Boom. You're journaling now. Therapy not included.<br>

## Sample Entry<br>
Date: June 23, 2025<br>
Mood: sleep-deprived<br>
Entry: Refactored a thing that I still don’t understand. Why does it work now? No clue. Might be magic. 10/10.<br>

## Why Use This?<br>
You forget what you worked on unless Git tells you.<br>
You need to fake productivity for standups.<br>
You just want a little box to scream into, but professionally.<br>
Roadmap(aka TODOs I’ll probably never do)<br>
Dark mode for your soul<br>
Export as PDF so you can feel legit<br>
Tags like “bugged out” and “cried gently”<br>
Maybe an API if I lose my mind further<br>

## License<br>
MIT — do whatever. Just don’t make it worse.<br>

## Final Thoughts<br>
CommitLog doesn’t judge.<br>
It remembers, when you don’t.<br>
It’s like version control, but for your emotional damage.<br>
